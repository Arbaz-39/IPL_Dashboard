Objective:
The aim of this project is to create an interactive and visually appealing dashboard that provides insights into the 
Indian Premier League (IPL) from 2008 to 2024. This dashboard enables users to analyze key statistics, trends, and 
performance metrics of teams and players over the years.

Dataset used: In order to complete this project, I have to used used two sheets:
  1. Matches_data : This sheet contains information about each matches that has been played between 2008 and 2024.
     It contains 1095 rows and 20 columns. Each row represents a match played between two teams.

  2. Winners_data: This sheet contains 17 rows and 5 columns. Each row represents each year final match winner and its
     corresponding Season, Winner, Runner Up, Player of the Series, Man of the Match.
         
Tools and Techniques Used:
   1. Excel: The primary tool used for data analysis and visualization.

   2. Pivot Tables: To summarize large datasets, allowing for quick calculations and aggregations of player and team statistics.
      
   3. Pivot Charts: To visualize data from pivot tables in various formats (bar charts, line graphs, etc.), making it easier to interpret trends.
      
   4. VLOOKUP: To fetch related data from different tables, facilitating more comprehensive insights (e.g., player performance across different seasons).

   5. Slicers: To provide interactive filtering options, allowing users to view specific data segments (e.g., year).
   
Key Features of the Dashboard:
  1. Interactive Visualization:Users can interact with the dashboard through slicers to filter data by year 
  dynamically updating the visualizations and metrics displayed.
  
  2. Performance Metrics:The dashboard displays key performance indicators (KPIs) such as winner, runner up, man of the match,player of the series,
  providing a comprehensive overview of IPL performance over the years.
  
Trends and Comparisons:
  Visualizations include column charts, bar charts, pie charts, treemap to show trends over multiple seasons for direct comparisons.
  
Historical Data Analysis:
  Users can analyze data from 2008 to 2024, observing how team strategies and player performances have evolved over time.
  
Example Insights:
   Identify the top-performing team in terms of wins across different seasons.
   Analyze the performance trends of specific players, showcasing improvements or declines.
  
Conclusion:
   This IPL dashboard project not only enhances data visualization skills but also demonstrates the ability to leverage Excel's powerful features 
   for meaningful analysis. It serves as a valuable resource for cricket enthusiasts, analysts, and anyone interested in the statistics of the IPL.
